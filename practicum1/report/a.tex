The Euclidean distance between the $n$-dimensional points $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ is defined as:
	\begin{equation}
		d(\vec{a},\vec{b}) = \sqrt{\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (a_i - b_i)^2}.
	\end{equation}
My implementation of this formula is provided in \autoref{lst:a:euclideanDistance}.

The length of the polygonal line created by drawing line segments between consecutive points from the list $[\vec{p_0}, \ldots, \vec{p_n}]$ is:
	\begin{equation}
		\sum_{i=0}^{n} d(\vec{p_i}, \vec{p_{i+1}}).
	\end{equation}
The first step of my implementation computes the list \t{pairs}, which contains all pairs of points between which the distance should be computed. Actually computing this distance, using the function \t{euclidean\_distance} and summing the results gives the length of the requested line, see \autoref{lst:a:pathLength}.
